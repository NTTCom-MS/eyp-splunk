#   Version 6.5.1

# Modify the following line to suit the location of your Splunk install.
# If unset, Splunk will use the parent of the directory containing the splunk
# CLI executable.
#
SPLUNK_HOME=/opt/splunkforwarder

# By default, Splunk stores its indexes under SPLUNK_HOME in the
# var/lib/splunk subdirectory.  This can be overridden
# here:
#
# SPLUNK_DB=/home/build/build-home/ivory/var/lib/splunk
# Splunkd daemon name
SPLUNK_SERVER_NAME=SplunkForwarder

# Splunkweb daemon name
SPLUNK_WEB_NAME=splunkweb

# If SPLUNK_OS_USER is set, then Splunk service will only start
# if the 'splunk [re]start [splunkd]' command is invoked by a user who
# is, or can effectively become via setuid(2), $SPLUNK_OS_USER.
# (This setting can be specified as username or as UID.)
#
<% if defined?(scope.lookupvar('splunk::forwarder::os_user')) %>
SPLUNK_OS_USER = "<%= scope.lookupvar('splunk::forwarder::os_user') %>"
<% else -%>
# SPLUNK_OS_USER
<% end %>
